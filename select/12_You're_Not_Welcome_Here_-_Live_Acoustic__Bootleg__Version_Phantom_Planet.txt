Upon the hour of your arrival
I will draw the line
You take your side of the city
Don't set foot on mine

You told me when we met
I told you when we left
That we're through
We're through
So I thought
You knew
You disappeared
Now you're not welcome here

Across the park we used to walk through
Keep that for yourself
Well the bench that heard
You wouldn't have me
That's for someone else
That is mine to keep
That is mine to keep
I know at least
I said my peace
Made it clear
That you're not wlecome here

I told you when we met
You told me when you left
I know at least
I said my peace
Made it clear
That you're not welcome here
You're not wlecome here
You're not wlecome here
You're not welcome here
