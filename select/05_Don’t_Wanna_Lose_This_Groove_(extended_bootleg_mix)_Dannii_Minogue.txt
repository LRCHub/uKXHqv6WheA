'Cos I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me every time I need it
Ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me more, and more

Don't wanna lose this feelin'
That you're givin' me every time I need it
I ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me, more
(Give me more)

I'm back for more and I got the cure
I know where I'm going for sure
What we threw away, we should be saved
Come and make my day
I said some things
That did not ring true (Now I know your mine)
I said some things I did not mean to
Now I'm back for more (more)

'Cos I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're givin' me every time I need it
Ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me more, and more

Don't wanna lose this feelin'
That you're givin' me every time I need it
I ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me, more
(Give me more)

I'm ready, come get me
And give me some more, give me some more
I'm ready, come get me
And give me some more

Don't wanna lose this feelin', lose this feelin'
That you're givin', feelin' every time I need it
Wanna lose this feelin'
What you're givin' I need
What you're givin' me more
Don't wanna lose this feelin'
Wanna lose this feeling

(Fade Away)
